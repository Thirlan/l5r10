      <h1>Legend of the Five Rings - 10th Century</h1>
      <p>Custom rules for Legend of the Five Rings RPG using 4th edition rules and set in the 10th century.</p>
      <h2>Why the 10th Century?</h2>
      <p>The 10th century is a popular setting for Legend of the Five Rings, as it represents a time of peace before the great upheaval that comes with the Scorpion Clan Coup and the Clan Wars. It is a setting with few legends and heroes, giving the players a blank slate upon which to leave their mark.</p>
      <h2>Challenges of the 10th Century</h2>
      <p>The 10th century can be best compared to the Edo period in Japan, where the country was relatively isolated and stable, allowing for a flourishing of culture and society. In the same way, the 10th century in Rokugan is a time of relative peace and stability, with few major conflicts to disrupt the flow of daily life. This thus places a lot of emphasis on the rituals of life and political intrigue in Rokugan versus the lawless nature of the Clan Wars.</p>
      <h2>Why Custom Rules?</h2>
      <p>Legend of the Five Rings 4th Edition is no longer a supported system, as such, incorporation of erratas, era-specific rules, and other customizations are necessary to maintain a balanced and enjoyable gaming experience.</p>
      <h2>Why 4th Edition?</h2>
      <p>4th Edition provides a solid foundation on which a custom ruleset can be built upon using its' numerous rulebooks released over the many years.</p>
      <h2>What can I find in this ruleset?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorporation of official erratas</li>
        <li>Era specific rules (e.g. Agasha family is still with the Dragon Clan)</li>
        <li>Fixes to various rules and mechanics</li>
        <li>Quality of life improvements such as calendars, events and an era specific map</li>
      </ul>
