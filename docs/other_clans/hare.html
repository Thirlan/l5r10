    <h1>Hare Clan</h1>
    <p>The Bloodspeaker Iuchiban was a maho-tsukai of epic power, a terrifying madman who repeatedly threatened the safety of the Empire. The ronin Reichin heroically risked his life to combat Iuchiban's rise and was rewarded for his services with permission to found the Hare Clan. His descendents have continued down the same path, fighting Bloodspeakers at every turn, and later also confronting the insidious secret conspiracy called the Kolat. The clan has tiptoed the edge of extinction several times and only survived through sheer dedication to its cause.</p>
    <h2>Families</h2>

    <h3>Usagi</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Awareness</p>    
    <p>The Usagi have seen combat for almost their entire history. Because they know hidden threats like the Bloodspeakers and the Kolat exist, they are always alert and ready to spot signs of corruption. Unfortunately many elder members of the Usagi tend toward paranoia and do not trust strangers, although younger family members are usually more confident and optimistic.</p>

    <h2>Schools</h2>
    <h3>Usagi Bushi</h3>
    <p>The Hare Clan has seen a lot of combat for a Minor Clan. Their continued war against the enemies of the Empire has raged for centuries without an end in sight. Consequently, the Usagi Bushi School is one of the better-developed Minor Clan warrior schools. It has been perfected in battle and blood, as the Hare Clan has painstakingly learned what works and what simply fails.</p>
    <p>The Usagi Bushi School takes the athleticism of the Hare Clan and channels it into combat advantage. The Hare learn to move faster than the average samurai, darting in to deliver a punishing blow then dashing out of range of any counterattack. An unprepared opponent is quickly overwhelmed as he is attacked from what seems like all sides.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Bushi</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Reflexes</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics (Running), Defenses, Hunting, Jiujutsu, Kenjutsu, Lore: Maho, any one High or Bugei skill</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 4.0</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Ashigaru or Light Armor, Sturdy Clothing, Daisho, Bow (with 20 arrows) or Knife, Traveling Pack, 3 koku</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Rank 1: Speed of the Hare</em> The Hare are known for fighting with a speed and agility reminiscent of the animal for which their clan is named. In any situation where you have room to dodge, jump, and otherwise maneuver (GM's discretion), you may add your Athletics Skill Rank to your Armor TN except when in the Full Attack or Center stance. Your Water Ring is considered 1 higher for purposes of how far you can move with Move actions.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 2: Leap of the Hare</em> The Hare bushi has learned to strike with a devastating springing attack that catches many opponents off guard. If you are in the Full Attack stance, you can leap forward and attack an opponent up to 15' away without taking a Move Action. All of your attacks on this turn must target that opponent.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 3: Swift as Lightning</em> The speed and flexibility of the Hare allows him to strike with fearsome rapidity. Your attacks with unarmed strikes, knives, or Samurai-keyword weapons are considered Simple Actions.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 4: Kick of the Hare</em> The Hare has learned not only how to strike with speed, but also how to dodge and avoid his foes at the same time. You may now perform your Rank Two Techniques while in the Attack stance instead of the Full Attack stance. If you perform the technique in the Full Attack stance, you may make your second attack of the Round against another opponent within 15' of the first opponent.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 5: Reichin's Style</em> The final lesson of the Hare school is a whirling flurry of leaps, feints, and attacks that come at the opponent from all directions, confusing and disorienting him. You may perform the Feint Maneuver for only 1 Raise, and your damage bonus from a successful Feint is not limited to your Insight Rank x 5.</li>
