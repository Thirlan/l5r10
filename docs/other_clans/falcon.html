    <h1>Falcon Clan</h1>
    <p>The founder of the Badger Clan was a powerful Crab warrior who proved his worth in a contest of strength in front of the Emperor. The descendents of the first Badger live on the northern border of Rokugan, and are tasked with guarding the Empire from foreign invasion. The Badger take after their Great Clan cousins, embracing strength at the expense of refinement, and do not accept defeat even in the face of insurmountable odds.</p>
    <h2>Families</h2>

    <h3>Ichiro</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Strength</p>    
    <p>The Ichiro are rude and course in their interactions with the rest of the Empire. They believe in action over words and pragmatics over societal norms. The Ichiro are stocky by nature, and their mountainous lifestyle ensures a heavily muscular frame.</p>

    <h2>Schools</h2>
    <h3>Toritaka Bushi</h3>
    <p>The Toritaka Bushi School excels at destruction of creatures that come from the other Spirit Realms. Their style is fluid in order to adapt to any surprises that new monsters might spring upon them. Unfortunately this focus on otherworldly foes makes the Toritaka bushi a very specialized warrior, with few techniques that work against human opponents.</p>
    <p>The Toritaka Bushi School focuses on striking monsters and bypassing their defenses. They use the daisho or the spear to find the monster’s weaknesses and relentlessly attack them until they fall. Over a lifetime of training, the Toritaka learns to see past the tricks a monster may utilize and to efficiently dismantle such enemies.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Bushi</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Strength</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Animal Handling (Falcons), Hunting 2, Kenjutsu, Etiquette, Lore: Spirit Realms, Spears, any one Skill</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 5.5</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Light Armor, Sturdy Clothing, Daisho, any 1 weapon, Traveling Pack, 3 koku</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Rank 1: The Falcon's Eyes</em> A Toritaka must be aware of his surroundings at all times, for his enemies can appear anywhere. You add +1k0 to all Skill and raw Trait rolls involving the Perception Trait. Additionally, when striking a creature from another Spirit Realm (including oni from Jigoku and hungry dead from Gaki-do), you add +1k0 to all damage rolls.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 2: The Falcon Takes Flight</em> Through his training, the Toritaka can sense the emanations of nearby spirits as they cross over into the mortal realm. You may attempt to detect the presence of any creatures from other Spirit Realms by making a Perception Trait Roll against a TN equal to the creature’s Air Ring x 5.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 3: The Falcon's Wings</em> The Toritaka strikes with precision, constantly keeping his enemies at bay. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action while wielding a spear or a weapon with the Samurai keyword.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 4: Vigilant and Strong</em> Monsters may have tricks to confuse their enemies, but the Toritaka learns to see the truth through the fog. You may spend a Void Point to negate any darkness or blinding penalties. This effect lasts until the Reactions Phase two Rounds later.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 5: Claws of the Falcon</em> Nothing will stop the Toritaka’s attack from hitting its target. Your attacks ignore up to 5 points of your opponent’s Reduction (if he has any). Against creatures from other Spirit Realms, you may spend a Void Point as a Free Action to reduce the creature’s Reduction by 10 for one Round.</li>
    </ul>
