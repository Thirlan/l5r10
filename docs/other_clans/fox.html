    <h1>Fox Clan</h1>
    <p>Emperor Hantei Genji declared to Shinjo that he would see to the welfare of these people, and when the bulk of the Ki-Rin departed and their remaining people were forced out of their lands by bandits and then the Lion, he declared that this remnant were to be the Fox Clan - the first minor clan recognized by an Emperor. The Emperor also forbade anyone from declaring full-scale warfare of Great Clans against Minor Clans. In 90, he resettled the Fox in the lands below the southern Spine of the World Mountains, granting them the land of Kitsune Mori, closer in proximity to Otosan Uchi than the original Ki-Rin lands, so he could keep the children of his sister Shinjo close to him. The Fox took the Ki-Rin's place at court and represented that clan's interests while it was abroad.</p>

    <h3>Kitsune</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Awareness</p>    
    <p>The Kitsune are a simple, quiet people who prefer to commune with the spirits of nature in the forest rather than travel across the Empire on formal business.</p>
    
    <h3>Kitsune Shugenja</h3>
    <p>The Fox Clan is located next to one of the largest forests in Rokugan, a fact that has shaped the direction of their lessons. Each Kitsune shugenja gains a love for the spirits and the tranquility of the deep forest after countless hours meditating within its borders. This connection between man and beast is encouraged and strengthened with comprehensive lessons.</p>
    <p>The Kitsune's love for nature is evident in the abilities taught at their school. The Kitsune can connect with the wilderness and the animals that inhabit it. It is a versatile technique that can be vital to the Kitsune shugenja's duties, and few from other schools can duplicate the Fox's abilities.</p>
