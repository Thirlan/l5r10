    <h1>Mantis Clan</h1>
    <p>The Mantis Clan is adaptable and unpredictable, and many find the Mantis to be much like the seas on which they travel from their island holdings to the mainland Empire. The Mantis are perhaps the most diverse and individualistic of the Clans. The Mantis clan is still a minor clan in this era and has not absorbed other minor clans. </p>
    <h2>Families</h2>

    <h3>Mantis</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Stamina OR +1 Intelligence</p>    
    <p>the Mantis are descended from the Crab, and are equally hardy in their own way. They are the unquestioned masters of the seas, having dwelled on the Islands of Silk and Spice for the entirety of their existence. They are a hardy, industrious people ever eager to prove themselves against the other clans.</p>

    <h2>Schools</h2>
    <h3>Mantis Bushi</h3>
    <p>The Mantis are masters of the sea, and as a result of centuries spent fighting from ship to ship and on the beaches, their fighting style is highly unusual. The pitching and rolling of the waves has been incorporated into their style, which uses more movement than any School. Likewise the Mantis have learned that protracted fighting is almost always detrimental to naval combat, and they have learned to ruthlessly exploit any weakness in their opponents' defenses. Finally, the corrosive effect of sea air on steel is well known, and as a result the Mantis have centuries of experience fighting with highly unconventional weaponry, in particular the kind of weapon most often relegated to peasants.</p>
    <p>The Mantis Techniques essentially focus on dabbling in a little bit of everything. They have potent attacks, unhindered movement, and can cripple an opponent's Armor TN, among other things. The Mantis are jacks of all trades, but master of none, making them highly adaptable assets in a skirmish.</p>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Mantis Shugenja</h3>
    <p>There are few families in the Empire as diverse and ambitious as the Mantis, so it is no surprise the family supports a small number of shugenja. The tradition stems back to the earliest day of the Mantis Clan. Kaimetsu-Uo, the clan's founder, had no capacity to speak to the kami, but one of his daughters did and she married a ronin who possessed the same ability. Thus began a branch of the Mantis family that possesses an unparalleled ability to commune with the spirits of the sea and storm.</p>
    <p>For centuries, the small number of Mantis shugenja have maintained an inexplicably powerful link to the spirits of the sea and to a lesser extent the spirits of wind and storms. No shugenja in the Empire is at home on the seas as one from the Mantis family. The school maintains a number of small temples throughout the Mantis islands, but none are as well known as the infamous Tempest Island, a small island renowned for the battering it receives during storm season. It is here the most powerful among the Mantis hone their skills and power, making themselves a force to be reckoned with throughout the whole of Rokguan.</p>
