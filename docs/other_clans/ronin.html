    <h1>Ronin</h1>
    <p>Ronin are samurai who have been cast out of their clans, often due to dishonor or a desire to live outside the rigid social structure of the Great Clans. They wander the Empire seeking new purpose, often taking up employment as guards, mercenaries, or adventurers. While they may be seen as dangerous or unpredictable by those who know them, ronin are also known for their fierce loyalty to those who earn their trust.</p>
    <p>A ronin may encounter the chance to learn a Ronin Path when his Insight Rank has already exceeded the listed Rank of the Path. In these cases, the ronin is allowed to learn the Path at a higher Insight Rank instead, but for a Rank 1 Technique he must possess at least one rank in all School Skills taught by the Path.</p>

    <h2>Schools</h2>
    <h3>Grateful Student</h3>
    <p>Some true ronin shugenja are fortunate enough to find a sensei to help them along. This might be another more experienced ronin shugenja, or even a sympathetic shugenja of the Great Clans; some priests consider it blasphemous to ignore the gifts of the kami and will teach anyone who they judge can cope with the burdens and responsibilities of priesthood. The Brotherhood of Shinsei, which has numerous retired clan shugenja in its ranks, is another frequent source of such training.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Shugenja</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Intelligence</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Calligraphy, Lore: Theology, Lore (pick one), Meditation, Spellcraft, any two Skills</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 4.0</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong>  Sturdy Robes, Wakizashi, any 1 weapon, Traveling Pack, Scroll Satchel, 5 bu</p>
    <p><strong>Affinity/Deficiency:</strong>  Disciple shugenja typically have the same Affinity and Deficiency of their mentor, which of course varies wildly. You may choose one non-Void element in which you gain an Affinity. You are automatically Deficient in the opposing element.</p>
    <p><strong>Spells:</strong> Sense, Commune, Summon, 3 spells of your elemental Affinity, 2 spells of a non-Deficient element, and 1 spell of a second non-Deficient element. You gain additional spells for going up in Rank normally so long as you remain on good terms with your sensei.</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong> <em>Soul of Study</em> - Due to the lack of resources, ronin shugenja have to study their initial scrolls more than usual</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When casting one of your beginning spells (the ones given by your mentor as listed above), you roll an additional +1k0 on Spell Casting Rolls. This technique cannot be learned after Insight Rank 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wordly Wanderer</h3>
    <p>A ronin on this path does not have a sensei. Instead, the world itself is his teacher. Rough living on the fringes of society makes him strong, while observing the fighting styles of others and improvising his own makes him skillful. The results will lack polish, but they will work well enough.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Bushi</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Strength</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics, Defense, Hunting, Intimidation, Kenjutsu, any one Bugei Skill, any one Skill</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 4.0</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Ashigaru or Light Armor, Sturdy Clothing, Daisho, any 1 weapon, Traveling Pack, 1 koku</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Rank 1: The Way of the World</em> A ronin must press every advantage he has to survive his unfavorable circumstances. Choose two Advantages that are either Mental or Physical. Decrease their point costs by 2 each, to a minimum of 1.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 2: Harsh Lessons</em> Hunger and exposure to the elements have a wonderful way of focusing one's training. You may purchase three Emphases for free. At least one of them must be for a Bugei Skill.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 3: Bite of the Wolf</em> A dedicated ronin can eventually match the speed of the clan bushi. Choose one specific weapon, like Katanas and yumis for example. You may perform attacks as Simple Actions when wielding the chosen weapon.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 4: Observe the Enemy</em> Through careful study and your own creativity, you are able to imitate the technique of a Clan school while making it different enough to avoid drawing their ire. Choose a Rank 1 Technique from a human bushi school that you could reasonably have observed over time. You are considered to have that Technique and it is part of this “school” for purposes of calculating your School Rank</li>
      <li><em>Rank 5: The Power of Incompleteness</em> There is wisdom to be found in the space right before perfection. Choose one of your Traits that isn't your highest or tied for highest and increase it by 1 Rank, as if you had spent Experience Points on it.</li>
