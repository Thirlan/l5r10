    <h1>Dragonfly Clan</h1>
    <p>An extremely devout and matriarchal people, the Centipede clan devoted themselves to the worship of the Sun for centuries. Their lands are to the east of Treacherous Pass in the Mountains of Regret lies the Centipede valley which was open to the sea, Tani Senshio.</p>
    <h2>Families</h2>

    <p>The Moshi family line bore mostly female children, the first Moshi had eleven daughters and no sons, and had become matriarchal because of it.</p>

    <h2>Schools</h2>
    <h3>Tonbo Shugenja</h3>
    <p>The Tonbo are a deeply spiritual people. They have forged a strong connection to the mountains and remain in their lands even though hardship after hardship has fallen upon them. Though the Tonbo Shugenja are no less priests than their counterparts in the other Clans, they are acutely aware of the political responsibilities that rest on their shoulders. As the intermediaries between the Dragon Clan and the rest of Rokugan, the Tonbo are well equipped to survive the perilous courts of the Empire.</p>
    <p>The Tonbo Shugenja School uses all the resources at its disposal to prepare its students for the courts. A trained Tonbo can use his connection to the spiritual world to heighten his social graces. This boost is often a necessity with opponents such as the Lion Clan always watching for a social faux pas.</p>
