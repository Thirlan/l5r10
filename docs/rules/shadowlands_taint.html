    <h1>Shadowlands Taint</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Shadowlands Taint is a manifestation of Jigoku's corruptive influence on the moral world. It functions as a disease, spreading upon contact, but corrupts the soul as readily as the body. Those subjected to the taint slowly face strange mutations, exhibit unnatural strength and unholy powers, and become violent and malicious as the taint subverts their thoughts and dreams. Corpses suffused with the taint return as undead abominations.</p>
    <p>Much like Honor and Glory, one's Taint is representing through Ranks and Points. Whenever a character is exposed to Taint from an outside source, they must make an Earth roll to resist it. The roll's TN depends on the circumstance (from 10 from a simple contact to 30 for being swallowed alive by an oni). Failure means gaining a single point of Taint.</p>

    <h2>Living with the Taint</h2>
    <p>Oddly enough, it is not illegal in Rokugan to be Tainted. It is, however, illegal to conceal it. This is known as "harboring the Taint" and is considered a very serious crime, since anyone with the Taint has the potential to spread it, endangering the rest of the Empire. An individual who is found to be Tainted, or who admits to it, is placed under severe social restriction, and many such persons commit seppuku immediately to purge the shame of their state from their family line. Those who do not commit seppuku must endure a life of constraint and self-discipline. They are forbidden from marrying or bearing children (lest they spread the Taint), and are generally excluded from visiting court, attending festivals, or otherwise participating in public life. The Crab Clan's Kuni Witch-Hunters are notified of their condition and visit them regularly to check on their status and make sure their Taint does not grow. In return for all these restrictions, they are permitted to drink Jade Petal Tea - a special herbal infusion that enhances the body's ability to resist the Taint's growth.</p>
    <p>If a person is found to be severly Tainted - Level 4, or even lost - they are not allowed to live. Those of the samurai cast will sometimes be offered the chance for seppuku, especially if they still seem to be in control of their own mind, but if they refuse, they are immediately executed, without exception.</p>
    <p>Concealing the Taint is difficult. The more taint someone has, the more physical mutations and odd behavioral tics they will display. Kuni Witch-Hunters are trained to watch for these symptoms and behaviors, and some of the other Clans also have internal organizations which hunt for evidence of maho and Taint, notably the Phoenix Inquisitors and the Scorpion Kuroiban (Black Watch). Keeping one's Taint hidden from such observers and avoiding the sort of public breaches of etiquette that can expose the Taint can be quite challenging. Of course, the Taint itself sometimes offers subtle assistance to those who are trying to conceal their secret, granting powers that make contamination easier to hide.</p>
    <h3>Jade Petal Tea</h3>
    <p>Notwithstanding its evocative name, Jade Petal Tea does not actually contain jade. Rather, it is an herbal concotion created from a rare type of blossom, cultivated by the Brotherhood of Shinsei in a handful of monasteries. Drinking Jade Petal Tea causes most of the physical and mental symptoms of the Taint (such as discolored skin, bad odor, nightmares, etc) to go into remission, and also temporarily deactivates any Shadowlands Powers the character may have acquired. It does not, however, reverse serious mutations.</p>
    <p>So long as a Tainted character faitfhully drinks his tea every day these protections will remain in effect. In addition, the character will be much more resistant to any further growth of his Taint.</p>
    <p>Due to the well-known effects of Jade Petal Tea, those who wish to keep their Taint secret will often go to great lengths to procure it. The Kuni Witch-Hunters coordinate with the Brotherhood of Shinsei to keep track of who is receiving tea and ruthlessly hunt down those who smuggle it. In fact, unauthorized possession of Jade Petal Tea is often considered to be proof of Taint.</p>

    <h2>Gaining the Taint</h2>
    <h3>Active Infection</h3>
    <p>The Taint is infectious and malignant, always watching for a chance to spread. Any time a character is exposed to the Taint, however briefly, he must make an Earth roll to resist it. The TN of this roll depends on the severity of the exposure. Passive exposure to a Tainted environment (such as traveling through the Shadowlands without jade) is much less dangerous than a direct contact with a Tainted creature, for example. In situations where multiple conditions apply at the same time (such as being bitten by a Tainted creature while within the Shadowlands), roll once using the highest applicable TN.</p>
    <p>Each time a character fails one of these rolls, he immediately gains 1 point of Taint.</p>

    <h3> Growth of Infection</h3>
    <p>Once a character has the Taint, it will attempt to grow, slowly eating away at his body, mind and soul. Minor infection can be resisted fairly easily, but the Taint is persistent and never tires, and will seize on any moment of weakness. A character who is Tainted must make periodic Earth rolls to see whether his Taint has managed to grow. The frequency of these rolls, and the TN required, goes up as the Taint becomes stronger, as shown below on the table 4.2. Each time such a roll is failed, the character gains 1 additional point of Taint.</p>

    <p>A character who is drinking Jade Petal Tea on a daily basis gains a +2k2 bonus to these Earth rolls. Living a life of strict piety, meditation, and moral and physical purity can also make it easier to resist the Taint's growth, awarding anywhere from a +1k0 to a +3k0 bonus to the Earth rolls, at the GM's discretion. Many individuals who learn they possess Taint choose to retire to special monasteries, administered by the Brotherhood of Shinsei and regularly visited by the Kuni Witch-Hunters, where they can live pure and simple lives, drinking their Jade Petal Tea, and hopefully die without becoming Lost.</p>
    
    <h2>Protection from the Taint</h2>
    <p>The chief protection against the Taintt is the sacred substance known as jade. Formed from the tears of Lady Sun at the dawn of creation, jade possesses intrinsic powers of purity that resist the influence of Jigoku. A character who carries a piece of jade on his person gains a +10 bonus to all rolls to resist gaining the Taint. Likewise, touching jade to a potentially Tainted wound within a minute of injury will award a +10 bonus to a roll made to resist being Tainted.</p>

    <p>Jade does not protect against growth of Taint which the character already has. Furthermore, over time as jade absorbs more and more of the Taint, its protective qualities fade. It turns soft and brittle, discolors, and finally becomes corrupt and foul, eventually dissolving into black sludge.</p>

    <p>Crab bushi who go into the Shadowlands normally carry small pieces of jade to protect themselves and their food and drink from the realm's background Taint. These are referred to colloquially as "fingers of jade" and are considered standard issue equipment for anyone venturing into the Shadowlands. A finger of jade will normally last for one week, and the Crab seldom venture into Fu Leng's realm for longer than that. Multiple fingers of jade can extend the time, but since both are absorbing the Taint at the same time, they do not extend the duration by a full week each. Ultimately there is an upper limit on how long jade can protect someone from the Shadowlands, as shown on Table 4.3.</p>

        <th>Number of Fingers</th>
        <th>Length of Protection</th>

    <h2>Effects of the Taint</h2>
    
    <p>A character can always "embrace the taint" and add +1k1 to any physical roll in exchange for immediately gaining a single point of Taint. This cannot be prevented. Whenever a character has ten points of Taint, they gain one rank instead. The Taint manifests in various symptoms, such as the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mutations are the result of gaining ranks in Shadowlands Taint and represent difformities that must be concealed.</li>
      <li>Minor Shadowlands Powers are powers usable by the least powerful Tainted individuals. Using them forces the user to make an Earth Taint roll (TN 15) or gain an additional point of Taint.</li>
      <li>Major Shadowlands Powers are powers usable by the most powerful Tainted individuals. Using them forces the user to make an Earth Taint roll (TN 20) or gain an additional point of Taint.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Taint ranks</h2>
    <p><strong>Level 0 : Seeds of Darkness</strong> A character who has less than a full Rank of Taint is not actually considered to be Tainted. Such minor levels of infection show no symptoms, and cannoted be detected by any known means - even spells like Jade Strike that specifically target Tainted individuals will not harm a person at this minor level of infection. At worst, the victim might experience a few bad dreams.</p>
    <p><strong>Level 1 : Passive infection</strong>A character with a full rank of Taint is recognized as Tainted by specific spells and abilities, but otherwise functions as normal. They suffer from occasional nightmare, and may feel sick or tired.</p>
    <p><strong>Level 2 : Active infection</strong>A character with two full ranks of Taint now experiences painful symptoms, such as nightmare, nausea and vomiting, muscle tremors, and mild hallucinations. They also develop a single Shadowlands power (minor or major, but most often minor).</p>
    <p><strong>Level 3 : Consuming</strong>A character with three full ranks of Taint becomes paranoid and transformed, suffering from a -1k0 penalty to all Social skill roles. They also develop a single Shadowlands power (minor or major), and a physical mutation.</p>
    <p><strong>Level 4 : Deadly</strong>A character with four full ranks of Taint barely function in normal society, and are haunted by madness, becoming obsessed with blood, death and flesh. suffering from a -2k0 penalty to all Social skill roles. In stressful situations, they must make Willpower rolls (TN 15) or resort to violence. Their maximum number of Void points is reduced by one. They also develop two Shadowlands powers (at least one major), and one physical mutation. If discovered, the character may be forced to commit seppuku, or be killed as an enemy of the empire.</p>
    <p><strong>Level 5 : Lost</strong>A character with five ranks of Taint becomes Lost, unless they are exceptional (such as having one Ring as rank 6 or higher), in which case they wait until seven ranks. Several things can then happen: most often, the character is disintegrated, or becomes permanently mad as it is claimed by the Shadowlands, with all its mental traits reduced to one, and is treated as a creature.</p>
    <p>Some characters manage to survive the ordeal as the Lost, or Akutsukai, becoming abominations under the GM's control. They have no longer any penalties for having the Taint, gain 0-3 additional mutations, and 0-3 additional Shadowlands powers. They can no longer embrace the taint, but instead add their Taint rank to all their physical rolls. Although they can be perceived as self-willed, Lost characters are in fact only driven by Jigoku, and are completely evil, without self-will, and with a twisted remnant of their former self as their only personality.</p>
    
    <h2>Mutations</h2>
    <h6>Albinism</h6>
    <p>Your skin and hair become deathly pale, perhaps even stark white. This is very unsettling in appearance. but can be concealed with cosmetics. You suffer a -1k0 penalty to social rolls if your true appearance is known.</p>

    <h6>Beast of Fu Leng</h6>
    <p>The most terrible of mutations, this causes you to completely lose human form, distorting into a bestial or monstrous body - typically a quadruped or a bloated, ogre-ish humanoid. This severe deformity cannot be hidden, and causes a Fear 1 effect in anyone who sees it.</p>

    <h6>Chitinous Armor</h6>
    <p>Your skin has hardened into an insect-like shell that protects you physically but also exposes your inhuman nature. This grants you Reduction of 10 (which stacks with any Reduction you gain from armor, spells, or other effects).</p>

    <h6>Demonic Eyes</h6>
    <p>Any time you are in darkness or shadow, your eyes glow with an unnatural blue light. This allows you to see through darkness or other visual impairment 'such as smoke or fog).</p>

    <h6>Discolored Skin</h6>
    <p>Your skin turns an unnaturally pale or dark shade. This can be explained away as the result of an indoor or outdoor life, but regardless, it inflicts a +5 TN penalty to all Social rolls.</p>

    <h6>Distorted Limbs</h6>
    <p>One of your arms or legs, randomly chosen, becomes misshapen or twisted, rendering it useless. This is an obvious deformity that is extremely difficult to conceal. although it can probably be explained away as the result of an injury. If the deformed limb is a leg. you gain the Lame disadvantage. If It is on arm, you suffer a -3k0 penalty to any rolls made with that arm.</p>

    <h6>Extra Digit</h6>
    <p>You sprout an additional finger or toe. This is an obvious but minor deformity. It does not automatically suggest the presence of Taint. but it does make those who notice it uneasy, causing you to suffer a -1k0 penalty to all social skill rolls. If the digit is cut off, it will regrow within 48 hours.</p>

    <h6>Extra Eye</h6>
    <p>An additional eye sprouts somewhere on your body. This grants you +1kO to Perception rolls and Perception-based Skill rolls, but the eye must be uncovered (and thus possibly noticeable to others) to gain this benefit.</p>

    <h6>Extra Limb</h6>
    <p>Your character sprouts an additional arm or leg. This limb is obviously Tainted, with discolored skin, claw-like nails, etc. It Is 50% likely to be non-functional, hanging limp from the body, In which case the resulting obstruction and clumsiness causes you to suffer a -1k0 to all Agility-based and Reflexes-based rolls.

    <h6>Forked Tongue</h6>
    <p>Your tongue becomes long and forked, like a snake's tongue. Concealing this mutation while speaking or eating requires a roll of Acting 1 Awareness at TN 20.</p>

    <h6>Foul Odor</h6>
    <p>You manifest an exceptionally putrid and disgusting body odor. Impossible to ignore. No amount of bathing or perfume can suppress it. You suffer a - 1k0 penalty to all Social rolls.</p>

    <h6>Jigoku's Blood</h6>
    <p>Your blood becomes black and foul-smelling. Anyone who sees you injured will recognize this as an obvious symptom of the taint.</p>

    <h6>Tentacles</h6>
    <p>You sprout one or more tentacles, which you are able to partially control. You can use them to pick up small objects, to make attacks with Small weapons. or to initiate a Grapple. Anyone seeing these tentacles will immediately recognize you as Tainted.</p>

    <h6>Tough Hide</h6>
    <p>Your skin becomes rough and leathery. This causes you to appear unnatural or diseased, inflicting a -2k0 penalty to all Social rolls However. your unnatural skin does provide some resistance to harm. granting you Reduction 5.</p>

    <h6>Undead Visage</h6>
    <p>You gain the outward appearance of being undead. with deathly gray skin, visible skin decay. and deeply sunken eyes. This deformity cannot be concealed. and causes a fear 3 effect on anyone who sees it.</p>

    <h6>Vile Teeth</h6>
    <p>Your teeth become distorted and/or discolored, to the point of appearing inhuman. They might become palmed or jagged, sprout animal-like fangs. turn a deep brown or sickly yellow color. etc. Concealing your grotesque teeth while talking or eating Is difficult, requiring a roll of Acting / Awareness at TN 20.</p>

    <h6>Wings</h6>
    <p>Your body has sprouted large wings that allow you to fly for short distances. These wings may be birdlike (feathered), leathery, or reptilian in nature. They can be folded up and with some difficulty can be concealed beneath a cloak or haori (with a roll of Acting / Awareness at TN 25). Folding or unfolding the wings is a Simple Action. When unfolded, the wings allow you to fly, with your Move Actions calculated at Water +2.
        
    <h2>Minor Shadowlands Powers</h2>
    <h6>Above the Elements</h6>
    <p>The power of Jigoku renders you resistant to normal (non-maho) magic. All normal elemental spells that could affect you suffer a +10 TN penalty to their Spell Casting Rolls. However, you are more vulnerable to the power of the kansen. and any maho spell that targets you gains a Free Raise. Any shugenja who casts Sense within range of you will notice a distinct absence of kami around you.</p>

    <h6>Blackened Claws</h6>
    <p>You have claws of obsidian. concealed within your fingertips, which you can extend as a free Action. The claws grant you a DR of 2k3 with unarmed attacks (in place of the normal Ok1) and are considered obsidian for the purpose of bypassing Reduction and Invulnerability. However. you feel the urge to use these claws every time you fight - you must make a Willpower Roll at TN 10 any time you start a fight with a weapon other than the claws.</p>

    <h6>Blessing of The Dark One</h6>
    <p>You have an unnatural resistance to pain and physical harm. Your Wounds at each Wound Rank are increased by 3.</p>

    <h6>Blood Knows Blood</h6>

    <h6>Calligraphy of Thought</h6>
    <p>You can read the surface thoughts of anyone within your line of sight. This is a Free Action and requires you to win a Contested Air Roll. With a success, you sense whatever the target is thinking about at that moment. This power cannot root out deeper emotions or subconscious knowledge.</p>

    <h6>Child of Darkness</h6>
    <p>The power of the Taint protects you from other servants of Jigoku. Shadowlands creatures will not attack unless you threaten them. If you can communicate with them, they might obey your commands. especially if you seem powerful or persuasive.</p>

    <h6>Eyes of Hell</h6>
    <p>The power of the Taint allows you to see with an unnatural clarity under any circumstances. You may choose to see through darkness, shadows, fog, smoke, or any similar visual impairment. However, whenever you use this power your eyes glow with an unnatural light (usually green or blue), betraying your presence and nature.</p>

    <h6>Fear</h6>
    <p>The power of the Taint allows you to unleash a wave of inhuman terror, freezing the blood of your enemies. Once per skirmish you can project an aura of fear, inflicting a Fear 5 effect on all your enemies within sight.</p>

    <h6>Jade Sense</h6>
    <p>You have an Innate sense for the presence of sacred substances such as jade. You can detect the presence of all jade, crystal, and obsidian near you, out to a maximum distance equal to Earth x 10 in feet. Concealing magic can obstruct this sense. You cannot detect Jade Petal Tea.</p>

    <h6>Master of Blood</h6>
    <p>The kansen are your friends, and you have an Innate talent for casting maho spells. You may cast maho for one less Wound than normally required, and the amount of Taint you gain from casting maho spells is reduced by your Earth (to a minimum of 1 point of Taint). All non-maho spells you cast. however, are at a +10 TN penalty.</p>

    <h6>Master of Shadows</h6>
    <p>You have an unnatural affinity for darkness and shadows. You may add your Taint Rank in unkept dice to all Stealth Skill rolls you make. You gain the Discolored Skin mutation if you do not already have it, as your skin develops a dark and shadowy tone.</p>

    <h6>Mind of Darkness</h6>
    <p>You may embrace the Taint to enhance your rolls with mental Traits (Intelligence, Willpower. Awareness. and Perception) in the same manner as you would normally enhance rolls with physical Traits. If you become Lost. you may add your Taint Rank to the total of all rolls made with mental Traits as well as all rolls with physical Traits.</p>

    <h6>Monstrous Strength</h6>
    <p>The Taint suffuses your muscles, giving you a swollen, unnatural build that unsettles those who meet you. You suffer - 1k0 to all Social rolls. In return, you add your Taint Rank in unkept dice to all Strength rolls, Strength-based Skill rolls, and Damage rolls you make.</p>

    <h6>Uncanny Speed</h6>
    <p>The Taint grants you speed greater than should be possible for someone of your size and strength. Your Water Ring is considered to be two Ranks higher for the purpose of how far you can move with a Simple or Complex Move Action. In return, you are fidgety and nervous. unable to sit still for more than a few minutes.</p>

    <h6>Unholy Stamina</h6>
    <p>You may go without rest or sleep for up to three days with no penalties of any kind. This power must be reactivated after three days, requiring another roll to resist gaining Taint.</p>

    <h2>Major Shadowlands Powers</h2>
    <h6>Beside the Darkness</h6>
    <p>You have the ability to temporarily suppress your Taint. making it impossible for others to detect. If you meditate uninterrupted for a period of 2 hours and make a Meditation/Willpower roll at TN 20, you can "metabolize" your Taint for a period of 8 hours, During that time, you are not considered Tainted for mechanical purposes. and spells and Techniques which target Tainted creatures will not affect you. Physical mutations (such as extra limbs) will remain in place, however. This power cannot be ended before its duration expires. While it is in effect, you cannot use any of your other Shadowlands powers, cannot cast maho, and cannot embrace the Taint to enhance your rolls.</p>

    <h6>Blood Domination</h6>
    <p>Your blood carries your will, and any creature who drinks or otherwise ingests so much as a spoonful of your blood (equal to 1 Wound) will be subject to your demands. You may make a Contested willpower roll against such a target to force them to obey your commands for a number of hours equal to your Taint Rank. You cannot force them to directly kill themselves, but all other commands - including potentially lethal orders like 'Fight that oni' - must be obeyed. If you fall the Contested Willpower Roll. the target will be aware of your attempt. and you may not try to command that target again for one full day.</p>

    <h6>Chosen of Fu Leng</h6>
    <p>The Taint grants you an unnatural strength of will. allowing you to shrug off any attempt to influence your mind or opinions. Any attempt to influence you with Social skills or Techniques, or to control your mind through spells, will automatically fail.</p>

    <h6>Drawing Out the Darkness</h6>
    <p>The Taint has the power to evoke Taint in others, spreading corruption far and wide. If you can maintain physical contact with another creature for at least 1 minute. you may make a Contested Willpower roll. If you win the roll, the victim gains a number of points of Taint equal to your current Taint Rank. If you fail the roll, nothing happens, although the victim will feel a sense of unease and perhaps a physical chill.</p>

    <h6>Father of Lies</h6>
    <p>The Taint thrives on deception, and strengthens your own efforts to trick. deceive, and manipulate others. You may add your Taint Rank in kept dice to any rolls made with the Temptation or Intimidation skills or with the Deceit emphasis of the Sincerity skill.</p>

    <h6>Feeding on Flesh</h6>
    <p>The Taint draws strength from un-natural acts, especially the taste of blood and raw meat. You may take a Simple Action to feed on the flesh of a person or creature who is either dead or helpless to resist you, eg: Down or Out, bound securely, etc. This inflicts 1k1 Wounds on the target (if they are still alive) and heals you a number of Wounds equal to 5 x your Taint Rank.</p>

    <h6>Protection of the Dark</h6>
    <p>You are considered to be Invulnerable. in the same manner as some creatures. Whenever you ignore damage due to this Power, your skin glows with a throbbing black energy that is impossible to hide.</p>

    <h6>Strength of Madness</h6>
    <p>You can draw on your own physical essence to enhance your actions, much In the way that normal humans draw on the Void. A num-ber of times per day equal to your Earth Ring, you may suffer Wounds equal to your Earth to replicate the effect of spending a Void Point. This power can-not be used to reduce damage, but any other normal effect of Vold Points - including activating School techniques or awarding a +1k1 bonus to rolls - can be duplicated.</p>

    <h6>Thy Master's Will</h6>
    <p>The Taint will not allow you to truly die - you are too useful to Jigoku's purposes. If you are killed, you will return from the dead at some later time, as an intelligent undead creature. You retain all Rings. Traits, abilities. School techniques, and Skills, but no longer have a Void Ring. Your body is undead. and will begin to rot and decay over time.</p>

    <h6>Undead Strength</h6>
    <p>Your body does not feel pain, and continues to function normally even after suffering devastating injuries. You do not suffer Wound penalties - no matter how many Wounds you suffer, you continue to operate at full effect until you are actu-ally killed.</p>

    <h6>Unearthly Regeneration</h6>
    <p>The Taint infuses your body with a horrible vitality, healing injuries within minutes. Each Round at the start of your Turn, you heal a number of Wounds equal to your Taint Rank. Healed injuries leave no scars behind, and while you do not regrow lost limbs, such limbs will reattach If held in place for a few minutes.</p>

    <h6>Unholy Beauty</h6>
    <p>Jigoku considers you to have use as an Infiltrator within the Empire. You do not suffer any outward. visible effects of the Taint. and any physical mutations you already possess will fade away. You may still gain Shadowlands Powers normally but they do not exhibit any perceptible physical symptoms. However, your body will mutate internally to compensate for the lack of external change, exhibiting redundant or distorted organs, cancerous tumors, and other distortions.</p>
