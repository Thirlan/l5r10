    <h1>Unicorn Clan</h1>
    <p>The Unicorn, once known as the Ki-Rin Clan, were absent from the Empire for nearly eight centuries as they wandered the world, exploring and ensuring that there were no external threats to the Emperor that might remain unknown. Since their return, they have been regarded by many as barbarians and outsiders, due mostly to their embrace of customs that are in stark contrast to the norm for Rokuan. Still, the Unicorn are universally respected because of their cavalry. They use gaijin steeds and their horse-mounted troops are without compare in the Empire.</p>

    <h2>Families</h2>

    <h3>Ide</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Perception</p>
    <p>The public face of the Unicorn, the Ide have worked tirelessly to cmobat the perception many have of the Clan as barbarians and near-gaijin. They flawlessly merge the traditions of their people with the customs of the Empire, and in doing so seek to earn the gradual respect and acceptance of other clans. Samurai of the Ide family are almost universally even-tempered and eager to forge alliances with others, whether personal or larger in scale.</p>

    <h3>Iuchi</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Intelligence</p>
    <p>Tthe Iuchi family is probably the most militant shugenja family in the Empire. They serve in the armies of the Unicorn Clan in considerable numbers, and while they enjoy friendship and scholarly debate as much as any priests, they do not shy away from conflict when pressed.</p>

    <h3>Moto</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Agility</p>
    <p>The Moto exemplify virtually every negative stereotype that the Unicorn Clan as a whole has struggled with since their return to the Empire centuries ago. More than any other family, their gaijin blood is obvious from the look of them, short, and squat as they are. They are alternately boisterous and brusque, depending upon the circumstances, and rarely fit in well with samurai of other Clans. They are respected, however, for their warrior traditions.</p>

    <h3>Shinjo</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Reflexes</p>
    <p>Lords of the Unicorn clan, the Shinjo are an affable, industrious family whose members adapt easily to almost any task set before them, and who work well with others in virtually any situation.</p>

    <h3>Utaku</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Stamina</p>
    <p>The matriarchal Utaku family are rigidly honorable and pious individuals with carefully defined duties depending upon their gender. Women are generally trained to serve with the most elite cavalry units in the world, the Utaku Battle Maidens, while the men manage the households and serve among the legions of infantry in the Unicorn army.</p>
    
    <h2>Schools</h2>
    
    <h3>Ide Emissary</h3>
    <p>The Ide Techniques focus on a calm mind, serenity in all things, and meditation. They are the most pacifistic of any courtier tradition among the Great Clans, save possibly for the Asako of the Phoenix Clan. The intensity of their conviction with regard to pacifism has waxed and waned over the years, but on the whole they remain devoted to defusing conflict whenever possible. This makes them welcome allies to some Clans, and meddling outsiders to others. The Ide accept compliments and criticism with equal cheer.</p>
    <p>The Ide Techniques are different from most courtier Techniques in that they are entirely non-offensive in nature. The Ide specialize in protecting themselves from the ramifications of their actions, and in attempting to defuse conflicts among others.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Courtier</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Awareness</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Calligraphy, Commerce, Courtier, Etiquette (Conversation), Horsemanship, Sincerity (Honesty), any one High or Perform skill</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 5.5</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Extravagant Clothing, Wakizashi, any 1 weapon, Calligraphy Set, Traveling Pack, 10 koku</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Rank 1: The Heart Speaks</em> The Ide are taught to adapt instantly to new customs and social nuances, allowing them to avoid giving offense in even the most dangerous and hostile of courts. Also, since they must often deal with foreigners who might react poorly to lies or manipulation, they are taught to employ honesty and direct speech whenever possible. In any situation in which you might inadvertently give offense, whether through accident or ignorance (such as being unware of a daimyo's hostility to a particular subject of conversation), you may roll Etiquette (Courtesy) / Awareness at TN 20 to avoid doing so. You gain a Free Raise when rolling Sincerity (Honest), but any time you roll Sincerity (Deceit), your TN is increased by +5.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 2: Piercing the Veils</em> After centuries of dealing with unpredictable and sometimes violent folk in the Burning Sands, the Ide have learned an almost preternatural ability to read the emotions of others, recognizing their true feelings and, hopefully, steering away from trouble. You may attempt to read someone else's true emotions in a social situation by making a Contested Social Roll of Etiquette / Awareness against the target's Etiquette / Willpower. With a success, you gain a simple, general idea of their true feelings - which can be very useful when those feelings are not the same as their outward actions. You may Raise for better information, subject to GM's adjudication. (For example, two Raises might tell you, "The Doji is actually hoping for your success against the Dragon.")</li>
      <li><em>Rank 3: The Heart Listens</em> The Ide family's training emphasizes friendship and good personal relations as the key to successful diplomacy. You may attempt to sway someone's attitude toward you in a positive direction. This requires spending at least 10 minutes in conversation, after which you may make a Contested Roll of your Sincerity (Honesty) / Awareness against their Etiquette (Courtesy) / Willpower. With a success, you shift their attitude toward you in a positive direction. (A hostile individual will become more neutral, an undecided individual will become friendly, etc.) If you make at least two successful Raises on this roll, the target will regard you as an Ally for the remainder of this day (subject to GM approval).
This technique cannot be used on Sworn Enemies, and the GM is the final arbiter on whether it functions against unusual targets such as nonhuman creatures.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 4: Answering the Heart</em> At this level of training, the Ide have become true masters of mediation, able to see past all the deceptions and false fronts of diplomacy and discern the true solution to any problem. When using your Rank Two and Rank Three techniques, you may roll additional unkept dice equal to your School Rank.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 5: The Immovable Hand of Peace</em> The final lesson the Ide school teaches its students is to be such perfect mediators that no honorable person can raise a hand against them in violence. You may spend a Void Point to make a Contested Roll of your Sincerity (Honesty) / Awareness against a target individual's Etiquette (Courtesy) / Awareness. If you win the roll, the target cannot take any hostile action against you (physical, social, or magical) for a number of hours equal to twice your School Rank, as long as your likewise refrain from hostility against that person. This Technique does not work agaisnt those with an Honor Rank less than 2.0 or who possess no Honor Rank (animals, oni, etc).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Iuchi Shugenja</h3>
    <p>With the possible exception of the Tamori, the Iuchi are the least conventional and conservative shugenja family in the Empire. They are wild and carefree, and as many of their sensei's lessons are taught in the open plains as in the temple. This stems from their history of teaching while the Clan was traveling through distant realms. The impact of those years is also felt in the diversity of the family's magical styles. The Iuchi embrace, among others, the style called meishodo, which involves the creation of magical talismans that shugenja can draw on in lieu of the kami.</p>
    <p>In keeping with the theme of the Unicorn in general, the Iuchi Technique enhances movement and allows for unparalleled speed, even among the Unicorn. Their ability to cast more powerful Travel spells further enhances their skill in this area.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Shugenja</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Perception</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Battle, Calligraphy (Cipher), Horsemanship, Lore: Theology, Meditation, Spellcraft, any one High or Bugei Skill</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 5.5</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Extravagant clothing, wakizashi, Scroll Satchel, any 1 weapon, Calligraphy Set, Traveling Pack, Horse (Unicorn Riding Horse), 10 koku</p>
    <p><strong>Affinity/Deficiency:</strong> Water / Fire</p>
    <p><strong>Spells:</strong> Sense, Commune, Summon, 3 Water, 2 Earth, and 1 Air</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong> <em>Spirit of the Wind</em> - The Iuchi harness the power of the elements to grant the waves' speed to others.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As a Complex Action, you may sacrifice one spell slot of any element to grant one target individual an additional Simple Move Action. This Simple Action is in addition to the target's normal Actions per Round. The Additional Action must be used on the target's next Turn or it is lost.</li>
      <li>You gain a Free Raise on any spell with the Travel keyword.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Shinjo Bushi</h3>
    <p>The Shinjo school excels at mounted tactics by incorporating a number of gaijin combat methods encountered during the clan's centuries of travel outside the Empire. The result is an exotic fighting style that makes them awe-inspiring opponents on the battlefield, even as it earns them the enmity of all those who despise deviation from the customs and nature of Rokugani warfare. However, the school does have surprising philosophical side as well, one that merges the rough lessons of barbarian horsemanship with Shinsei's wisdom. All in all, the Shinjo Bushi are flexible cavalry warriors with a knack for improvisation and defensive techniques that help them get into position for tactical harassment orprecision strikes</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Bushi</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Agility</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics, Defense, Horsemanship 2, Kenjutsu, Kyujutsu, any one Skill</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 4.5</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Ashigaru or Light or Riding Armor, Sturdy Clothing, Daisho, Bow and 20 arrows, Knife, Traveling Pack, Horse
(Unicorn Riding Horse), 10 Koku, and any one weapon</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Rank 1: The Way of the Unicorn</em> The Shinjo have gained a surprising amount of wisdom from centuries spent studying their horses. When spending a Void Point to add +1k1 to a roll involving any Bugei Skill or the Animal Handling Skill, you may also add your Horsemanship Skill Rank to the total. This bonus cannot be used while in the Center Stance. Additionally, you gain a bonus equal to your Void Rank to the total of all Horsemanship rolls that you have not spent a Void Point on.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 2: Dance of the Blade</em> - The ancient gaijin battle techniques practiced by the Shinjo have given them a defensive edge against many styles within the Empire. You add +1k1 to your Defense Skill Rolls. In addition, you suffer none of the Skill Roll penalties from wearing riding armor while on foot or using bows from horseback.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 3: The Four Winds Strike</em> The swift and relentless assault of a Shinjo is a dreadful sight to behold for his enemies. You may make attacks as a Simple Action rather than a Complex Action when wielding scimitars or weapons that have the Samurai keyword. If you are fighting while mounted, you may also attack as a Simple Action when wielding a bow or spear.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 4: Spirit of the Blade Unleashed</em> Those who mistake the defensive style of the Shinjo as weak can find themselves brutally surprised in the last moments of their lives. If you are in the Full Defense Stance, you may make one normal attack with a melee weapon as a Free Action, ignoring the restriction of the Stance.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 5: Dancing with the Fortunes</em> Some call it luck; the Unicorn call it “dancing with the Fortunes”. During a skirmish and while mounted, when you wish to spend a Void Point you may make a Void Ring Roll (TN 20) as a Free Action. If the Ring Roll is successful, you gain the mechanical benefit of having spent the Void Point without actually spending it. This does not actually create a bonus Void Point, it simply generates the mechanical effects of spending one. If the roll fails, you spend the Void Point as normal. You may only use this Technique a number of times per skirmish equal to the number of Void Points you had at the start of the skirmish. You may utilize this Technique when on foot as well, but the TN of the Void Ring Roll increases to 30.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Utaku Battle Maiden</h3>
    <p>The Utaku Battle Maidens, also known as the shiotome, are the finest and most respected cavalry in all the Empire, feared by reputation even more so than their kindsmen among the Moto and Shinjo families. While the remainder of the Clan trans on gaijin riding horses, a larger and sturdier breed than the simple Rokugani pony, the Utaku alone have the right to breed, raise, and ride into battle the legendary Utaku steeds, the finest horses in the world.</p>
    <p>Like other Unicorn bushi Schools, the Utaku Battle Maiden Techniques focus on mounted combat, although not to the total exclusion of non-mounted abilities. On a horse, however, an Utaku is a threat to virtually any human opponent. Honor is an important trait for a Battle Maiden as well, and the higher an individual's Honor, the greater the bonuses they receive.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Bushi</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Reflexes</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Battle, Defense, Horsemanship 2, Kenjutsu, Sincerity, any one High or Bugei Skill</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 6.5</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Light or Riding Armor, Sturdy Clothing, Daisho, any 1 weapon, Traveling Pack, Horse (Utaku Warhorse), 10 koku</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Rank 1: Riding in Harmony</em> The Utaku Battle Maidens value honor above all. You gain a bonus equal to your Honor Rank to one attack per Round. While mounted, you may instead choose to apply to bonus to one damage roll if you choose. You gain a bonus equal to your Honor Rank to the total of all Horsemanship rolls.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 2: The Void of War</em> An Utaku can sacrifice defense for speed if the flow of the battle calls for it. During Stage 1 of any Combat Round, you may add 5 to either your Initiative Score or your Armor TN. This bonus lasts until you use this Technique again or the skirmish ends.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 3: Sensing the Breeze</em> The natural feel of the saddle lends an Utaku unnatural freedom of movement. While mounted, you may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 4: Wind Never Stop</em> Like the wind across the battlefield, the charge of an Utaku is unstoppable. While mounted, you may overrun the enemy spending a Void Point. You may take a Simple Action to charge the enemy and attack him at the end of your movement. (Both the movement and the attack take the same Simple Action. If you are mounted, this Action uses the movement rate of your steed.) If this attack succeeds, you gain a bonus of +2k1 to the total of all damage rolls this Turn.</li>
      <li><em>Rank 5: Utaku's Blessing</em> The Utaku carry the honor of their founder as their shield. At the beginning of your Turn, you may spend a Void Point as a Free Action to activate this Technique. You add your Honor Rank to all damage rolls and Bugei Skill Rolls this Turn. This bonus stacks with those from Riding in Harmony.</li>
