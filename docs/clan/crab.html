    <h1>Crab Clan</h1>
    <p>The stalwart Crab are the defenders of Rokugan, responsible for ensuring the Empire's southern border is secure against the demons of the Shadowlands. Centuries of constant warfare against inhuman foes have hardened the Crab into tremendously powerful and brutally practical warriors, but they have little sense of civility or manners. As a result they are often considered crude and barbaric by the other clans.</p>
    <h2>Families</h2>

    <h3>Hida</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Strength</p>    
    <p>The descendants of the Kami Hida are among the largest and most powerful samurai in all the Empire. The burden of defending the Empire falls upon them, and they are both incredible warriors and skilled defensive tacticians. Hida samurai often resent the other Clans for enjoying their protection even as they mock the Crab for their mannerisms.</p>

    <h3>Hiruma</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Agility</p>
    <p>Silent and deadly, the Hiruma are the scouts and yojimbo of the Crab. They are as agile and graceful as the Hida are powerful, and warriors from the two families tend to complement one another very well. Hiruma samurai often have the unsavory duty of scouting the Shadowlands for enemies, a task that leads many to death or ruination.</p>

    <h3>Kaiu</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Intelligence</p>
    <p>The industrious Kaiu are responsible for the most impressive and long-standing feats of engineering in all the Empire. They are the siege engineers and architects of the Crab Clan, and are responsible for maintaining the Great Carpenter Wall as well as its defenses.</p>

    <h3>Kuni</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> +1 Intelligence</p>
    <p>Sinister in appearance and deed, the Kuni are among the most feared shugenja families in the Empire. Long ago, the family's leadership determined the only hope of defeating the Shadowlands lay in understanding it, and so the Kuni possess knowledge of things that would drive most men mad.</p>

    <h3>Yasuki</h3>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> Awareness</p>
    <p>Strangely at odds with the other Crab families, the Yasuki are slight of build and devious of mind. They were once part of the Crane Clan, but joined the Crab in the third century, provoking the first great internal war in Rokugani history. They are merchants and courtiers, always looking for any means to gain an advantage for their Clan, and tend to be more concerned with monetary gain than is considered respectable for someone of the samurai caste.</p>
    
    <h2>Schools</h2>
    <h3>Hida Bushi</h3>
    <p>The Hida fighting style is one of the oldest and most respected bushi schools in the Empire, and one with a very basic premise: endure the enemy's attacks until you have the opportunity to crush him with sheer brute force. The style was shaped by the Clan's early years combating oni and other Shadowlands enemies, when only the strongest and most resilient among Hida's followers survived. The Hida Bushi School encompasses two broad themes: damage mitigation and heavy weapon use. Hida bushi may not be the most accurate samurai in the Empire, but when they do connect, they inflict tremendous damage. And fortunately for them, they are able to withstand incredible amounts of punishment while they wait to cripple their enemies.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Stamina</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Battle, Heavy Armor, Katana, Tattooing, Jiujutsu</p>
    <p><strong>Honor:</strong> 6.5</p>
    <p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Katana, Heavy Armor (Lamellar), Ashigaru Armor, 20 koku</p>
    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Rank 1:</em> Crab Hands — When making a TN 5 attack, add Stamina Ring to damage</li>
      <li><em>Rank 2:</em> Stand Like Stone — Non-combat action to reduce damage taken by Stamina Ring until next turn</li>
      <li><em>Rank 3:</em> Armor of the Crab — When wearing heavy armor, gain additional TN against ranged attacks equal to Stamina Ring</li>
      <li><em>Rank 4:</em> Walls Do Not Fall — Non-combat action to designate an adjacent character; they add your Stamina Ring to their armor TN</li>
      <li><em>Rank 5:</em> Strength of the Mountain — When your armor TN would be exceeded, may spend a Void Point to negate the excess</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Hiruma Bushi</h3>
    <p>Where the Hida Bushi School teaches endurance and strength, their Hiruma cousins teach avoidance and targeting weak points in an enemy's defenses with lightning fast strikes. The lessons taught by their sensei are essential to fulfilling their duties as warriors inside the Shadowlands. Those who do not heed their teachers well do not survive to perpetuate their mistakes. Those who excel at their lessons become a scourge upon the Shadowlands, moving through that dark realm with speed and grace, leaving death in their wake.</p>
    <p>The Hiruma Bushi School emphasizes movement and survival, not just to endure a strike as the Hida do, but to live through an entire skirmish. In one-on-one combat the Hiruma excels at evading his opponents, while in larger skirmishes his ability to avoid damage makes him adept at reaching troublesome foes and eliminating them while his allies tie up other rank-and-file opponents.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Reflexes</p>

      <li><em>Rank 5:</em> Legion of One — When outnumbered, add Reflexes Ring to your Armor TN</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Kuni Shugenja</h3>
    <p>Once misunderstood, the Kuni Shugenja School has frequently been painted as a collection of obsessive madmen who delve too deeply into secrets no one should explore. Most Kuni would object to the label of madman, but beyond that they would admit the stereotype fits fairly closely with reality. The Kuni understand they must sacrifice certain inhibitions and reservations in order to serve their Clan and Empire to the best of their ability, and they do so without protest.</p>
    <p>The Kuni Shugenja School emphasizes the Crab Clan's specialization in fighting creatures of the Shadowlands. The Crab's alliance with the Nezumi tribes that dwell within the region also has granted them great insight into other non-human creatures, and their Technique allows them to benefit or destroy such creatures as desired.</p>
